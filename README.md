# authMERNredux

## The database config is in the server/.env file. I had used mongodb atlas instead of local mongo server.

### Step 1. Run command "npm i" on the root directory as well as on "./server/" directory to install all the required packages. 
### Step 2. Run server/mainFile.js as node command to start the Express server.
### Step 3. Run npm start on the root directory to start the React app.

### The App initialization completed.

# Thank you.
